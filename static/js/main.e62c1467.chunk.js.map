Why this might be is an open question, but Melville certainly went into this endeavor not knowing what exactly it was he planned on writing, so when he starts he does so with a cookie-cutter (for the time), mediocre sea yarn about a character named Ishmael, his meeting of a savage, and their eventual hire on a whaling vessel. This sub-book is fine enough if you're into that sort of thing, but it didn't do much for me, and it's not why Moby Dick is remembered as it is.</p>\n\n    <p>The next sub-book is a one for which no one asked and is the reason this book should never be assigned in high school. It's\n      a nonfiction book about the whaling industry in the 1800s. This book is so astonishingly boring that it beggars\n      belief. Everyone has at one time or another caught themselves at the end of a paragraph and realized they just moved their eyes over it without reading, but never before have I had that happen for pages at a time. Here is one of many gems that\n      Melville grants his lucky readers:</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts\n      are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in\n      him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged\n      with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the\n      spout — whether it be water or whether it be vapour — no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it\n      is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories.\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <aside><cite>The Fountain</cite></aside>\n\n    <p>It is amazing how that ended up in a novel. In another chapter Melville starts by claiming that</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      The allusion to the waif-poles in the last chapter but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of\n      the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\n    </blockquote>\n    <aside><cite>Fast Fish and Loose Fish</cite></aside>\n\n    <p>I disagree, as I imagine most readers would, but he nevertheless he goes on to educate his reader on this most important of topics:</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the\n      States-General in A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American\n      fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\n      comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of\n      Meddling with other People's Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne's forthing, or the barb of a\n      harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>At this point I'm indulging myself by throwing in quotes that annoy me, but allow me one more, as this one is comically bad:</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      But the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.\n    </blockquote>\n    <aside><cite>The Affadavit</cite></aside>\n\n    <p>This passage reminds me of my English papers in high school in which I would try to find the most verbose possible way to say nothing at all in order to get to the required word count. All Melville was trying to get across in the above passage was that the reader might not know some things, so he intends to tell you, which isn't something that even needs saying; we, as readers, are reading because we know Melville has something to say. He doesn't need to convince us that he should be writing what we are already reading.</p>\n\n    <p>But then, at the end, a third sub-book emerges from the depths, so to speak. The third book is about Captain Ahab, and is incredible. It has a depth and tragedy and majesty and power so effective that it deserves to be read by everyone who is serious about literature. It is phenomenal.</p>\n\n    <p>As a small demonstration of Melville's power as a writer in this third book, here is a passage in which Captain Ahab is talking to Starbuck, the first mate, after Starbuck implores him to abandon his reckless quest for vengeance against an animal.</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel,\n      remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and\n      jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so\n      much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is\n      an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart\n      beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not\n      I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike.\n    </blockquote>\n    <aside><cite>The Symphony</cite></aside>\n\n    <p>He then then turns to Starbuck. Tragically, however,</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>Such effective and affective writing is hard to come by, and the last third of Moby Dick is full of it. I often had to put the book down after reading certain passages in order to absorb what it was I had just read. This third book is why Moby Dick is remembered, and why it deserves to be so. It's just a shame Melville took two other books to get to it.</p>\n\n    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n    <p>Melville truly did accomplish something with Moby Dick, but it is marred through and through with blatant flaws. In one\n      chapter, <cite>The Cabin</cite>, Melville even forgets that he's writing from Ishmael's perspective, and describes a\n      conversation to which Ishmael obviously would not have access. And in the last third or so of the novel Ishmael is\n      essentially absent from the story entirely; only in the epilogue does Melville remember he was writing this book in the\n      first person.</p>\n\n    <p>This kind of obvious and technical flaw is especially harmful when you consider that this book is so often assigned to\n      high schoolers, most of whom have no awareness of the amazing world of literature. When they start reading they might\n      put up with the sea yarn, but the copious nonfiction will make this book such a chore that before the worthwhile reading\n      comes they've already given up, just using spark notes to get the assignments done.</p>\n\n    <p>Not only this, but there are some genuinely weird and almost disconcerting sections:</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed\n      that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands\n      in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this\n      avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally [...] Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us\n      squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.\n    </blockquote>\n    <aside><cite>A Squeeze of the Hand</cite></aside>\n\n    <p>And when this is a book that is regarded as highly as it is, and is given to them as an example of quality literature,\n    they only end up taking away from the experience that literature is stodgy and boring and weird and, worst of all, not for them.\n    They will never see the incredible and tragic human drama at the end for which this book is justly praised and which anyone\n    would enjoy, and instead think mediocre and weird stories about savages and nonfiction about whaling is what their\n    teachers think make great literature. It's a crime to assign this book to people who are not already invested in\n    literature.</p>\n\n    <hr></hr>\n\n    <p>Ultimately, all I'd say is that you really do need to read this book, but that when you do, get an abridged version.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","export default function Serfdom() {\n  return <div>\n    <h2>Serfdom | A Short Story</h2>\n\n    <p>The sun shone more brightly than usual when Vasily Ilyanovich took his first steps, as did the eyes and smile of his\n      mother. Dinara was twenty one years old, and the sight of her firstborn on the journey in which he would become a man\n      like his late father brought her a joy only enriched by the recollection of her deceased husband. She sat on a rocking\n      chair in a small room, which apart from that chair contained only a small bed and small crib, a world unto itself\n      provided entirely by Count Andrei Nikolaevich Khilkov, a man whose extraordinary wealth was exceeded only by his natural\n      affection for all men (though especially women). Like many Russian nobility in 1853, Khilkov was deeply conflicted about\n      his ownership of serfs, and so when Dinara’s husband (one such serf) fell to his death during the maintenance of\n      Khilkov’s estate a month before the birth of his son, the Count, while genuinely affected by the tragedy, was also\n      genuinely grateful for the opportunity to ease his confused conscience with the provision of housing for his late\n      worker’s widow in his estate.</p>\n\n    <p>‘Vasya! Keep going!’ Dinara’s world, which is to say her room, was larger than what everybody else called the world at\n      that moment. When Vasily rounded the corner of the bed such that his mother could no longer see him, she jumped from her\n      chair onto the bed and laid on her stomach with her head hovering above her son, the ecstatic look on her face\n      attracting him to her. Little Vasily reached his arms up to his mother, and upon doing so lost his balance and fell on\n      the floor, causing both he and his mother to laugh. She picked him up, rotating over to lay on her back, and held him up\n      above her for a moment before setting him down on her stomach. ‘Soon you’ll be walking and running and I won’t be able\n      to catch up to you!’ Caught off guard by what she herself had just said, Dinara burst into tears. Soon she won’t be able\n      to catch her son. Soon her entire world will have a will of its own, and even make mistakes. Soon this fragile little\n      child won’t have her help, just as he already lacked the help of his father, and what’s worse, won’t even need it…</p>\n\n    <p>Count Khilkov was pacing the halls of his enormous estate, entertaining a fantasy of showing the Emperor himself around\n      when he heard crying coming from the room to his left. Recognizing this room as that of Dinara, whom he preferred even\n      to his wife despite not being aware of it, he rushed in to provide the comfort he so enjoyed giving. When he entered he\n      saw dust illuminated by the sun hovering above a chair that was rocking despite being unoccupied, and on the bed the\n      crying mother with her son. ‘What’s wrong Dinara?’ he asked softly, and sat down on the bed to her right, putting his\n      hand on her shoulder and giving a slight squeeze. She answered by smiling and putting her hand on his, still crying\n      profusely. Her head was still over the side of the bed and unsupported, and was growing tired, but enjoying and wishing\n      to maintain the position of her benefactor she stayed in the position she was. They both stayed there for a minute while\n      Dinara’s crying gave way to a more tempered melancholy, enjoying the closeness only a particular mix of sadness and\n      happiness can provide.</p>\n\n    <p>When Dinara’s head finally became too sore to ignore, and well after Khilkov started wondering how long she would\n      maintain such a position, she sat upright and twisted around, putting her feet on the ground and her son in her lap.\n      Tired from crying, and seeing that the Count was aware of her soreness, she laid her head on Khilkov’s shoulder. Both of\n      them had a great deal of affection for the other, and on occasion wondered what another life would have allowed for\n      them, yet were both content with the way things were, their contentedness supported by the knowledge that their stations\n      afforded them no other possibilities. Aware of the impropriety, Dinara lifted her head a moment after placing it there.\n      They looked at each other.</p>\n\n    <p>‘My little Vasya took his first steps.’ Dinara explained, as if the Count still expected an answer to the question he\n      forgot he had asked. ‘Oh! How wonderful!’ he said with some confusion, and then turned to the baby, ‘I’ll expect you to\n      start working tomorrow then?’. He and Dinara shared a laugh, inspiring laughter in Vasily as well, before Khilkov got\n      up, wished Dinara and Vasily well, placing his hands on each of their backs for a moment, and rejoined the imagined\n      Emperor out in the hall.</p>\n\n    <hr></hr>\n\n    <p>Alone with her son once more, Dinara surveyed her world. The rocking chair had become still and Vasily quiet, and she\n      was brought memories of the first room the Count had given her. That room was several times the size of the one she\n      currently occupied, had hardly anything made without gold, had two tables of different sizes, a mirror, a wardrobe, a\n      bed with silk drapes and sheets and pillows, a lamp, a carpet, a silver and enamel samovar accompanied by a case for\n      china, books that Dinara could not read on account of her illiteracy, and other such superfluous nonsense that, in her\n      estimation, was an offense to her role in life. God made her a serf and so she was owed the life of one, nothing more.\n      Khilkov pushing opulence onto her was akin to a lion giving a fine steak to a horse; she admired the room as fitting for\n      a Count, as giving him life and helping him to be what he was, but to her it was indigestible, stifling rather than\n      enriching her life and alienating her from herself. ‘Master this is too much for me, surely-’ she had started to say to\n      the Count upon entering the room, before he interrupted her, ‘Dinara you are my guest and as such are entitled to the\n      best I have to offer. And please don’t call me master, I am merely your host.’ He then moved around the room showing off\n      the amenities, taking pleasure in introducing this poor serf to the luxury only he could (or would) offer her.</p>\n\n    <p>‘Here you will find the samovar, and here the tea. The wardrobe will fit far more than you’d think’ - he stopped himself\n      from saying ‘far more than you have’ - ‘so we’ll have to get you some more clothes. If you are ever bored feel free to\n      browse the literature, the selection isn’t much, but it’s all quite good. Have you heard of Herzen? Hasn’t written a\n      novel in so long but I so hope he will again, the man’s a genius. There isn’t a crib yet but we will have one brought in\n      when the time comes, which I can tell is very soon!’ - he was looking at her comically large stomach.</p>\n\n    <p>Khilkov continued along in this fashion for a while, frequently making asides Dinara didn’t understand yet could tell\n      were amusing, and so amused her regardless, only stopping when a servant came in informing him of a guest, at which\n      point he bade her farewell and to address any questions to either of his children, who were in rooms nearby. Alone, save\n      for the child in her belly, she grew uncomfortable. This was too much for her. Everything was still and resisted being\n      given life. When the Count was there everything was alive, everything was understood and had a purpose that could be\n      governed, but now that it was only her everything died. It was the stillness in her current room that reminded her of\n      all this, but she rejoiced in her ability to now give life to what she had. She had been given her current room when,\n      the morning after her first night in the estate, she was found on the floor by a servant, it being the only place she\n      could fall asleep.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","export default function Cello() {\n  return <div>\n    <h2>The Absolutely Definitive and Final Ranking of Bach's Cello Suites</h2>\n\n    <p>Bach's cello suites are a towering accomplishment of baroque music. Taking a single, ostensibly monophonic instrument and utilizing all of its abilities and intracacies Bach created some of the most iconic music of all time. Enjoying thousands of recordings since they were first recorded in the thirties by Pablo Casals, from the terribly over-rated (Yo-Yo Ma) to the terribly underrated (Thomas Demenga), these pieces of music have inspired for centuries, yet they have been lacking one thing: a clickbait ranking.</p>\n\n    <p>I've scoured the relevant literature for a proper treatment of the relative qualities of the movements of Bach's cello suites and have come away woefully disappointed. I found decidedly little, and what little I did find was decidedly mistaken, so as a gift unto mankind and his posterity I have taken it upon myself to settle the matter once and for all.</p>\n\n    <p>What you find before you is the definitive, final, authoratative, and likely divinely inspired ranking of all 36 movements of Bach's cello suites. This is not my ranking, but simply the truth.</p>\n\n    <p>You can find <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0PDTaNFc1ja5qV4i683nBa?si=c9RM3v94Q2CmLI50n9Kl5A\" target=\"blank\">the Spotify playlist here</a>.

Alternatively, you can click on the names of the titles to be taken to their recordings.</p>\n\n    <h3>A Brief Intro to the Cello Suites</h3>\n\n    <p>The cello suites were composed in the years around 1720, when Bach was Chapel Master at Köthen. The six suites are partitioned into six movements each, each movement (save for the prelude) named after a type of dance, despite the suites not being for dancing. For every suite the first four movements proceed as follows: prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande. The sixth movement is a gigue. The fifth movement, for every suite, is a pair of two: menuets for the first two suites, bourreés for the third and fourth, and gavottes for the last two.</p>\n\n    <p>The second and fifth suites are in minor keys, while all others are in major. Unique among the suites, the sixth was written for a five stringed cello, which makes it considerably more difficult to play than the other suites, but also makes it the most varied and interesting.</p>\n\n    <p>The cello suites were not particularly well known before the twentieth century. This changed when Spanish cellist Pablo Casals became the first to record them in their entirety, doing so between 1936 and 1939. Since then they have been recorded hundreds if not thousands of times, becoming some of the most well-known and performed pieces of music in history.</p>\n\n    <h2>The Ranking</h2>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AR2MoSWlXA\" target=\"blank\">#36 | Suite 5, Mvt. 4 - Sarabande</a></h3>\n    <p>Many classical music people act as if you are somehow obligated to like this particular movement, even going so far as calling it the \"heart and soul\" of the suites. If they think the heart of these suites is sparse and cold I suppose they're right, but that simply ain't so. Unharmonized, slow, dreadful (in the literal sense), this movement is the antithesis of the joy that runs through the rest of the suites. This movement may be well suited for funerals and shotgun weddings, but you certainly won't find anyone listening to it on the bus. This is the worst of all the movements.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFfiAy0NMg\" target=\"blank\">#35 | Suite 3, Mvt. 4 - Sarabande</a></h3>\n    <p>This is a nice piece, as all these movements are, but it's a little too slow and somber. The entire time you're waiting for it to go somewhere but it never does.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJzpdaaXaYU\" target=\"blank\">#34 | Suite 1, Mvt. 4 - Sarabande</a></h3>\n    <p>A nice, slow piece that functions better as background music, like many of the sarabandes.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRldFsc79v0\" target=\"blank\">#33 | Suite 4, Mvt. 4 - Sarabande</a></h3>\n    <p>This movement goes places, but it takes its sweet time. Again, like many of the sarabandes, it works better as background music and connective material than something you'd want to listen to intently on its own.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxC9ssrybxc\" target=\"blank\">#32 | Suite 4, Mvt. 1 - Prelude</a></h3>\n    <p>This is a much more interesting movement than the lower ranked movements, but gets this ranking because you hear the entire piece in the opening bar. It provides very little variation, which is fine, plenty of great music is repetetive, but when so many other movements do such much more it's hard to justify placing it much higher. Aside from a few brief moments, one of which is actually quite intense, you get the same even delivery of eighth notes for the whole movement.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkFFGVNErBk\" target=\"blank\">#31 | Suite 1, Mvt. 2 - Allemande</a></h3>\n    <p>A slow piece, quaint and nice. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable and sweet.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BzCfV6u0cg\" target=\"blank\">#30 | Suite 2, Mvt. 4 - Sarabande</a></h3>\n    <p>This movement, along with its accompanying prelude, establishes the sorrow conveyed by Suite 2. Even and mournful, this is a piece that would go well at a funeral (in a good way), as it offers a glimpse of hope on occasion.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZZJ4moX-f4\" target=\"blank\">#29 | Suite 4, Mvt. 2 - Allemande</a></h3>\n    <p>This lovely movement is peaceful, yet has a tinge of sadness. Commencing with an opening very similar to the prelude of Suite 3, it goes on to provide us with the rhythmic variation the prelude of Suite 4 lacked, while also removing some of the energy.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1yrdlcwxg\" target=\"blank\">#28 | Suite 2, Mvt. 1 - Prelude</a></h3>\n    <p>A tragic beginning to the most tragic of the suites. A patient and longing melody carries us through with little variation, as if resigned to its fate, until the ending brings us the only chords of the movement. This is a great establishment for the rest of the suite to build on.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtUDttqLNBo\" target=\"blank\">#27 | Suite 3, Mvt. 3 - Courante</a></h3>\n    <p>Beginning with a playful downward C Major arpeggio, as opposed to the C Major scale that opens the prelude of this suite, this movement then creates a very dancey vibe with consistently alternating rhythms, but the cello eventually takes over and the variations and complexity end up compromising that. This movement never takes a rest.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fop39j95MiM\" target=\"blank\">#26 | Suite 2, Mvt. 6 - Gigue</a></h3>\n    <p>This movement concludes the sombre second suite with a peculiar vivacity. Typically accelerating, this gigue pauses from time to time to catch its breath before going right back to energetic runs. The final bar in this movement, and thus the suite, concludes with a Picardy third of A Major, after having recently modulated there.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4dOdJu35RQ\" target=\"blank\">#25 | Suite 3, Mvt. 1 - Prelude</a></h3>\n    <p>A delightful and varied opening to the third suite. The beginning of this movement builds up our anticipation with a descending C Major scale and rewards that anticipation with all sorts of devices, sixteenth-note runs, pedal tones, chords, all before ending on with the same descending scale that opened the movement followed by a rich C chord. </p>\n\n    <hr/>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwFvKVsCnP8\" target=\"blank\">#24 | Suite 1, Mvt. 5 - Menuets</a></h3>\n    <p>An utterly delightful tune in two parts. The first menuet is playful, with a repeated motif of a descending fourth followed by a descending fifth, much as in the opening to the courante earlier in the same suite.</p>\n    <p>The second movement, however, is not playful at all. It begins simply and solemly on the B flat, marking the change to G Minor. Oddly enough, however, the key signature lacks an E flat, suggesting this menuet was written in Dorian. Gradually this second menuet garners more complexity, but doesn't shed its solmnity, and when we return to the first menuet it has become recontextualized, and feels different despite being the same.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-Wt1UU3lbk\" target=\"blank\">#23 | Suite 2, Mvt. 2 - Allemande</a></h3>\n    <p>A contemplative, sombre, slow tune. Beginning with a low D Minor chord that utilizes all four strings, the mood is made known from the outset. Following the opening chord in the lowest part of the cello there is an climb upward, where we get some flourishes. There are few four note chords elsewhere in this movement, but on the occasions they show up we're reminded of the presence of four voices. This movement flows from passage to passage, but nowhere in particular.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnijpB-6WCc\" target=\"blank\">#22 | Suite 3, Mvt. 2 - Allemande</a></h3>\n    <p>Much snappier than the other allemandes, this movement grows and steadily adds more energy. There are a few moments that excite - a tease of a modulation to G, low pedal tones accompanying climbing double stops - but those moments don't develop into anything truly climactic.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPNVu0R6p_k\" target=\"blank\">#21 | Suite 4, Mvt. 5 - Bourreés</a></h3>\n    <p>These bourreés both have consistent rhythmic signatures that repeat throughout, though those signatures differ a great deal from one another. The first is lively and bouncy, utilizing a short burst of sixteenth notes driving upward. The second bourreé is similar to the second gavotte from the sixth suite in its simple, plodding rhythm and harmonization with regular quarter notes from the bass. A lovely piece, despite being a little repetetive.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm97fx9sj2k\" target=\"blank\">#20 | Suite 4, Mvt. 3 - Courante</a></h3>\n    <p>Out the gate this movement displays some extremely varied rhythmic content, with triplets, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and quarter notes, which become the basis of the forward momentum for the rest of the movement.</p>\n    <p>A noticeable passage of this movement is the progression about the circle of fifths at the beginning of the second section, which culminates with a great deal of energy, yet that energy always feels like it's building for something that, unfortunately, only arrives later in the suite.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGZO_weMhSY\" target=\"blank\">#19 | Suite 5, Mvt. 6 - Gigue</a></h3>\n    <p>This movement seems to be striving for joy, but is restrained by the C minor of the suite, and so communicates a tragedy throughout. Much like the gavottes before it, there is a lingering sense of the joy that could have been. Nevertheless, this movement is snappy and fun. While the second suite conveys more tragedy, this movement effectively sends off a suite that used its minor key in more musically interesting ways, if less emotionally affecting.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_of-Ir3-4E\" target=\"blank\">#18 | Suite 1, Mvt. 1 - Prelude</a></h3>\n    <p>Yep. The most famous of all the movements, by orders of magnitude, is right in the middle. It's kind of frustrating how a piece can become one of the most recognizable pieces of music in the world despite being situated around over a dozen better movements. Frustration aside, however, it is still a great piece.</p>\n    <p>Written in a moto perpetuo style of constant sixteenth-notes, this is a movement where performers often take liberties with the rhythm, as is intended, and so this movement has seen many different interpretations (obviously). Unfortunately, the subject matter isn't complex enough to warrant so many interpretations, and many end up being quite similar. This movement alternates between stepwise motion and arpeggiation to create pleasing variety in the face of rhythmic homogeneity.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPuuNn7rCAU\" target=\"blank\">#17 | Suite 1, Mvt. 6 - Gigue</a></h3>\n    <p>Short and sweet, joyful and playful, this movement concludes the first suite with liveliness in a suite characterized more by restraint, which makes it a very welcome movement. Bounding up and down in volume, pitch, and speed, this movement is a pure delight and never fails to bring cheer. As the gigue, however, it's a bit on the short side.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6teeZ3W_22I\" target=\"blank\">#16 | Suite 4, Mvt. 6 - Gigue</a></h3>\n    <p>A lovely tune delivering a consistent wave of notes that feel like triplets, but are really eighth-notes in 12 / 8 time. The consistency and timing of this movement make it one of the most danceable. Eminently enjoyable and pleasing, but also one of the less adventuous gigues in the suites.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4oAKAyD9kk\" target=\"blank\">#15 | Suite 3, Mvt. 6 - Gigue</a></h3>\n    <p>A rhapsodic, powerful, and climactic conclusion to the third suite. This movement builds and builds, adding ever more complexity and interest, having a particularly explosive section occuring at the one-third and two-third points full of double stops, pedal tones, and sixteenth notes. This is an epic and exciting movement.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5PVg0ssa4\" target=\"blank\">#14 | Suite 5, Mvt. 1 - Prelude</a></h3>\n    <p>If Jon Snow had a theme song, this would be it, because this piece is brooding. An oddity of this suite is that performers often detune their A string to G, a full step lower. This causes there to be more resonance and depth given the key of G Minor, but can also be confusing to performers. Bach even notated the original score one step higher than is sounded, to allow performers to sight read at the expense of this confusion to their ears.</p>\n    <p>This prelude is actually a prelude and fugue, the fugue beginning abruptly at bar 26, when the time signature changes from common time to, oddly enough, 3 / 8. This is the only fugue in the entirety of the suites and is notable for its lack of harmony. In a set of suites full of chordal movements you would think that the only fugue would have some, but Bach deemed otherwise, and creates a very interesting effect by doing so, a testament to his skill and inventiveness as a composer.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pU18ZQd9K8\" target=\"blank\">#13 | Suite 6, Mvt. 4 - Sarabande</a></h3>\n    <p>The lowest ranked of Suite 6 (but the highest ranked Sarabande by far) places a respectable 13th. A beautiful, soothing melody that provides peace in a particularly energetic suite. This movement is reminiscent of the same suite's Allemande, and is in many senses a smaller version of that movement. It maintains its unique character, however, with richer chords and more inventive polyphony, while having less emotional weight. This is a piece that soothes and reassures.</p>\n\n    <hr/>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV9GBGgFrtw\" target=\"blank\">#12 | Suite 5, Mvt. 5 - Gavottes</a></h3>\n    <p>One of the most richly harmonized movements of all the suites, this movement is firmly rooted in C Minor yet still manages to get through to us a liveliness and jollity, as if it is soldiering on through hardship. The first gavotte is a tour through all sorts of different rhythms, while the second provides a consistent driving sixteenth note rhythm that flows nicely, though abruptly, back to the first.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5L3TqPFB4o\" target=\"blank\">#11 | Suite 6, Mvt. 2 - Allemande</a></h3>\n    <p>This is the longest and most emotional of all the movements. A stirring, haunting melody set to peaceful yet yearning chords. This is the kind of music that can be played at a funeral or a wedding; it is both tragic and hopeful, restrained and reaching. This movement comes much needed after the whirlwind of the movement that precedes it, and is a perfect example of how Bach inspired many of the Romantic composers after him.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jigOhqlwIpg\" target=\"blank\">#10 | Suite 2, Mvt. 5 - Menuets</a></h3>\n    <p>The first menuet is powerful and stately. It is in D Minor and it makes sure you know. The second menuet, on the other hand, is a calm detour through D Major, unadorned and relaxing, if a bit less interesting. The most surprising moment of the menuets is hearing what you heard before; the transition from the second menuet back to the first startles with its suddenness, making you almost offended on behalf of the second menuet that the first cuts in again.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_-e7pH5dYg\" target=\"blank\">#9 | Suite 2, Mvt. 3 - Courante</a></h3>\n    <p>The best movement of the second suite. This movement is virtuosic and intense. A flurry of sixteenth notes hit you throughout, alternating between minor and major tonalities the whole way through. The cello shoots up and crashes down, a movement-long climax in the middle of the tragic second suite.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-RX6GQUcMU\" target=\"blank\">#8 | Suite 5, Mvt. 2 - Allemande</a></h3>\n    <p>This movement, perhaps more than any other, has more to be discovered each listen. Clearly written as four voices, the bass voice is front and center, making it slow and thoughtful, yet also intense and commanding. Full of delightful twists and variations, this is one you could put on repeat for an hour and not get bored.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LSCyNV0rho\" target=\"blank\">#7 | Suite 6, Mvt. 3 - Courante</a></h3>\n    <p>This light-hearted fun tune expands on the ideas present in the first suite's courante, adding ever more energy and power. Particularly noticeable is the rapid sixteenth note assault in the opening bars lasting almost ten whole seconds. This movement simply does not rest, and is thrilling from start to finish.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG94HJ1tc7g\" target=\"blank\">#6 | Suite 3, Mvt. 5 - Bourreés</a></h3>\n    <p>An instantly appealing piece and the best of Suite 3. The first bourreé is a simple and lively statement of alternating rhythms and memorable melody. The second is a restrained counterpart to the first; reserved and tense, it seems as though it is always holding back, which only makes the restatement of the first bourreé more impactful.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enEYL_jpMvM\" target=\"blank\">#5 | Suite 6, Mvt. 6 - Gigue</a></h3>\n    <p>The final movement of the final suite is full of energy and opportunities for virtuosos to show off: rapid sixteenth notes, double stops, arpeggios, leaps and bounds between highs and lows, Bach brings it all to a close with this, and it's understandable why. While the finale of the sixth suite may lack the melodic interest of the gavotte or the wonder of the prelude, it is certainly Bach at his finest.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne-TPTh-Dk0\" target=\"blank\">#4 | Suite 5, Mvt. 3 - Courante</a></h3>\n    <p>The best movement in a minor key. Beginning with a forceful and startling octave from the lowest note on the cello, this movement briefly strays into a major mood, but quickly descends back into minor, where it stays save for brief moments. This movement is stern and direct and serious, but also has an undeniable energy and intensity.</p>\n    <p>This is the only courante in 3 / 2 time; all others are in a more typical 3/4. This contributes to the sense delivered throughout the movement, that it feels like a dance, yet something is off. The phrases are too pointed, the timing too strict. It's a sense that is both unsettling and wonderfully interesting, and what makes this movement so interesting despite being so short.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSjsu6DZdDs\" target=\"blank\">#3 | Suite 1, Mvt. 3 - Courante</a></h3>\n    <p>The third of all the movements, and the best of the first suite, gets third. This is the first movement in which we see true liveliness; movement one is gentle and consistent, and the second is slow and plodding, but this movement is bouncing between fast eighth-notes and slurred sixteenth-notes in a style clearly reminiscent of the dances from which all these movements derive their names.</p>\n\n    <p>Despite being expanded upon in the courante of the last suite, this movement places higher, as its simplicity is part of what makes it so great. A beautiful, celebratory, and just plain fun movement, this is one of Bach's best.</p>\n\n    <p> Also, as an aside, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gub04X4HxOc\" target=\"blank\">Peter Gregson's delightful recomposition of this piece.</a></p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xofCsB_a-s\" target=\"blank\">#2 | Suite 6, Mvt. 5 - Gavottes</a></h3>\n    <p>The penultimate movement gets the penultimate placing. Here we see the most melodic movement of them all, and undoubtedly one of the most memorable. The closest thing to a pop tune in the cello suites, and it's pretty close, the first gavotte almost demands a lyrical setting (and might already have one? There is an undeniable likeness to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEJ9P3JWmF8\" target=\"blank\">Heart and Soul</a>), while the second gavotte invites dancing with its pulsing pedal tone on the tonic.</p>\n    <p>This movement is certainly the most accessible to those uncultured swine who think classical music is boring, but is also thoroughly enjoyable for high-brow snobs as well. It's truly music for everyone, but isn't quite the best movement of them all. That honor goes distinctly to another movement of Suite 6.</p>\n\n    <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzXEpIM4MOs\" target=\"blank\">#1 | Suite 6, Mvt. 1 - Prelude</a></h3>\n    <p>What can be said of perfection?</p>\n    <p>The prelude to Suite 6, the only movement of all the suites Bach gave dyanmic markings, is everything from the rest of the cello suites and more in a single movement. If, as Rostropovich claimed, the sixth suite triumphs over the whole cycle, its first movement triumphs over the whole suite. Enchanting and soaring melodies, uplifting and joyful harmonies, powerful timbres and thrilling arpeggios, this movement has everything.</p>\n    <p>Initiating with a powerful statement reminiscent of the opening to the wonderfully exuberent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceo2QOtQtuM\" target=\"blank\"><cite>Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft</cite></a> (likely composed shortly after Cello Suite 6) around the tonic of D Major, it then breifly alternates between the tonic and subdominant before descending into an assault of contrapunal ferocity. We are carried through a tour of the cello and of the creativity and imagination peculiar to baroque music. The phrase that begins the piece is recapitulated throughout to bring us in and out of various tonal centers, where we are brought to tragic lows and epic highs, in every sense: minor and major, slow and fast, warm and bright, and in every combination possible.</p>\n\n    <p>Of particular note is the climax of the piece about two thirds of the way through, when a pedal tone on the dominant ramps up the anticipation to an almost unbearable degree. From this apex we are brought back into the lower register by rapid-fire arpeggios before returning to familiar territory. Despite the intensity and variety, we are somehow left unscathed at the end, as if having been carried gently through a whirlwind. At the finale we are finally brought to rest, brought back home to D Major, whirling from exhilaration.</p>\n    <p>This movement is truly the greatest piece of music ever written for the cello. T.H. White may have claimed that \"if you achieve perfection, you die,\" but Bach proves with this movement that perfection gives\n    ever more life.</p>\n\n    <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n    <p>Now that we've ranked the individual movements, we can rank the suites themselves. Below is each suite ranked by the average ranking of its movements (lower is better).</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Suite 6 : 6.5</li>\n      <li>Suite 5 : 15.5</li>\n      <li>Suite 2 : 21</li>\n      <li>Suite 1 : 21.2</li>\n      <li>Suite 3 : 21.7</li>\n      <li>Suite 4 : 25.2</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>No surprise that the sixth suite towers over the others, but the degree to which it does so is surprising. It's definitely very much helped by its solid sarabande, the movement that dragged down all the other suites, and the fact that it claimed the top two spots.</p>\n\n    <p>Speaking of sarabandes, lets look at the average rankings of the individual movements.</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Courantes : 11.7</li>\n      <li>Menuets / Bourreés / Gavottes : 12.5</li>\n      <li>Gigues : 16.3</li>\n      <li>Preludes : 19.7</li>\n      <li>Allemandes : 20.7</li>\n      <li>Sarabandes : 30.2</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>Clearly sarabandes are not for me, while courantes very much are.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course, it's silly to rank pieces of music. The quality of a piece of music is always relative to its purpose, and different pieces of music have different purposes. Any disco song is vastly superior to anything by Bach if your purpose is nostalgia for the seventies. That being said, sometimes it's fun to rank things in a completely arbitrary and personal way. I, in case you didn't notice, have a bias toward movements with lots of energy and excitement.</p>\n\n    <p>If you totally disagree (my last-place is probably a little controversial) feel free to make your own (wrong) list; thinking about the music you love and why you love it is a great exercise, and helps you get to know it better.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","export default function Heather() {\n  return <div>\n    <h2>Heather | A Short Story</h2>\n\n    <p>My sister would always tell me that I was wasting my time by looking into the sky, but I saw more in it than I saw anywhere on Earth. Today the moon was hung above the sun, placed by God, I would have to assume, as a sign meaning something very important, and I was looking very intently at it, as, you see, my sister was not around to intrude on my proclivities. I sat against the rock wall before my home; my mother would, time and again, yell at my sister and me for running along its top, but, you see, she was not here today either. Considering this, I knew I hadn’t occasion to worry about taking a break from my ruminations upon the firmament to quickly run along the rocks. I believe the rocks were first placed here by my father, who also liked to look into the sky. I remember last week he was feeling quite sick; I asked him again and again to come and tell me about the constellations, the titans that strode across the heavens just as I strode across the rock wall, but he discourteously declined, saying he wasn’t able, but that as soon as he felt better he would be sure to fill my mind with every star there was. I was so excited then.</p>\n\n    <p>I looked to my left and saw the dead grass. Most of our grass had dried up in the summer heat, just as many other things. Last time I went to get water from the town’s well I pulled up an empty pail. This, however, was more due to the well falling into disrepair than the heat, you see, but it stopped me from being able to bring water back home all the same. So it goes. I don’t mind suffering myself, so going without water wasn’t so bad, I just don’t like seeing others go through it. Though, if you think about it, if other people suffering brings me pain, then that is what suffering is to me, which I said I didn’t mind, so perhaps I’m wrong. Maybe I don’t like suffering. Maybe I hate it. I looked back at the moon and lost the will to consider my own suffering, as surely the moon, with all its spots and holes, all its craters and scars, has endured far more than I ever have or ever could. How lonely it must be up there. And cold. I know I couldn’t be the moon, so I’m grateful that the moon took it upon itself to be what it is.</p>\n\n    <p>A shadow passes across my view, its beak in the direction of my door.  I think the shadows started coming over last week, typically to talk with my parents. I always liked when they came over, as they smelled of refreshing heather, and looked like crows with white faces, but with the bodies of men. Their muffled voices sounded funny to me.</p>\n\n    <hr/>\n\n    <p>I was starting to get hot sitting still in the sun, so I decided to go see my friend. I walked across the heath, stepping on sticks and cracking grass. I saw the many homes that had recently become houses, among them the dwelling of my friend. I knocked on her door and she was the only one to answer. Her parents had left a few days ago. While I have curly, flaxen hair, my friend has wavy red, and she is very proud of this. Her family had been the only ones in the town that had had such hair, and it was always a sight to see them all walking together. She and I decided to climb our favorite tree.</p>\n\n    <p>I went right up to its trunk and looked straight up, to get the most impressive view of what I was soon to conquer. It had become less impressive since it dried up with everything else, but its height still impressed all the same. Quickly I jumped up and grabbed the lowest branch, which had felt my grasp countless times before, always followed by the pressure of my feet, first the left, then the right. But not this time. I tried again. I tried again. I knew my prior climb would have to stand as my last. I tried again…</p>\n\n    <p>I stop trying. My friend tries, and she nearly makes it too, but can’t muster it. She isn’t like me; this is her only attempt, and she starts crying. She starts sobbing. I can’t bear the suffering of others. I suffer it with them. I cry with her. I sob with her. It’s the plainness of the reality before us that brings our counterfeit world to an end. She and I sit against our favorite tree, the tree that had, in life, brought us so much joy, and now, in death, is here for our despair. I hold my friend and she holds me. We look down at our bony hands clasped together, tighter and tighter, a tension rising with the tenor of our cries, unable to look above, where the moon looms over the sun. I muster the strength to look in her eyes, but in them lose that strength. We collapse into each other as our hearts collapse inside of us. It took us so long. We did so well. But now, seeing each other’s fear and resignation manifest in her countenance, it’s finally too much to bear. I feel her bones against mine. Her shoulder juts against my arm, but I haven’t much feeling left anyway…</p>\n\n    <p>It comes time to stop. We get up and walk back to my house, picking heather along the way. It’s the only thing that hasn’t dried up. Hasn’t died. We get back just in time. The shadows, the doctors, are with my father, and my mother, and my sister, going with them as they leave the house. There goes my father. I look up, but see no stars. The sun is too bright. Then my mother. I hear her worried voice ordering me off the wall. Then my sister. I put my hands on the rocks we climbed as I see her hair, which was just like mine, poking out of the cloth that conceals the rest of her. My friend hands me the heather she picked, and I give it all to the last doctor. He looks at me and thanks me without gratitude, telling each of us to find him when the time comes for the other. His muffled voice is no longer funny. My friend is more affected that I am. I don’t know which of us will have to go with the doctor first. I hope I do. I can’t bear her suffering, and I’m so tired. She takes my hand and squeezes it, both of us so so afraid of letting go, both of us so so aware that we’ll have to, so so soon. We sit against the rock wall and fall against each other, and look into the sky, where I see more than I will ever see on the Earth. The moon hasn’t moved at all.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","export default function Algorithms() {\n  return <div>\n    <h2><cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> is a Bad Book</h2>\n\n    <p><cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> brands itself as a book that “explores the gap between theoretical ideas and pragmatic instructions,” but never ends up doing anything at all. After 196 pages all I came away with was a few examples of software (the author, Ed Finn, seems to think algorithms and software are the same thing) not behaving exactly as we'd like because of the messy nature of the real world.</p>\n\n    <p>But apart from listing examples anyone in the modern world could come up with, Finn also found it necessary to saturate his work with philosophical nonsense and buzzwords that not only add nothing, but detract significantly from whatever point was trying to be made (if there ever was one).</p>\n\n    <p>Consider the following examples, all taken from the first chapter:</p>\n\n    <blockquote>The pragmatic definition lays bare the essential politics of the algorithm, its transparent complicity in the ideology of instrumental reason</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>What are the truth claims underlying the engineer's problems and solutions, or the philosophy undergirding the technological magic of sorcery?</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>this notion of the organism as message reframes biology (and the human) to exist at least aspirationally within the boundary of effective computability</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>This fundamental alchemy, the mysterious fungibility of sorcery, reinforces a reading of the Turing machine as an ur-algorithm that has been churning out effective computability abstractions in the minds of its \"users\" for eighty years. The \"thing\" that software has become is the cultural figure of the algorithm: instantiated metaphors for effective procedures.</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>The algorithm is not a space where the material and symbolic orders are contested, but rather a magical or alchemical realm where they operate in productive indeterminacy.</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>In this light, computation is a universal solvent precisely because it is both metaphor and machine.</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>The algorithm of the progress bar depends not only on the code generating it but the cultural calculus of waiting itself</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>And the first tool, the ur-process, is the intersubjective culture machine of language.</blockquote>\n\n    <blockquote>It is rooted in computer science but it serves as a prism for a much broader array of cultural, philosophical, mathematical, and imaginative grammars.</blockquote>\n\n    <p>What in the world could any of that possibly mean? The needless scarequotes, pointless adjectives, and randomly calling things “magic” are themes that persist throughout this book and gradually erode any meaning it might have had.</p>\n\n    <p>I've read many bad books (I even subjected myself to <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>), but this book poses a larger problem than just my annoyance. The topic that Finn attempts to address is indeed important: algorithms and software are taking over our lives faster than any other technology has, and that poses dangers and problems that require scrutiny. But if someone wishing to think more deeply about this topic went to this book I can only imagine they would become discouraged, thinking the topic to be overly complicated, when really it's only Finn's deliberately obfuscatory language that's complicated. This book just muddies the waters around a topic that is actually fairly straightforward, and only does a disservice to the discourse around it.</p>\n\n    <p>The ostensible goal of <cite>What Algorithms Want</cite> still needs accomplishment, but must be done by someone willing to actually talk, in a straightforward way, about actual technical issues, instead of indulging in a need to seem smart.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","export default function Choplifter() {\n  return <div>\n    <h2>Don't Trust Everything You Read Online</h2>\n\n    <p>Often times before bed I like to play my Gameboy. Not my Gameboy Advance or Gameboy Color, but my good ol' fashioned DMG. What's nice about it is that the lack of a backlit display makes it easy on the eyes at night, so it doesn't hinder your sleep like a phone or computer would.</p>\n\n    <p>Well, one night I was playing one of my favorite games for the Gameboy, <cite>Choplifter II</cite>. Games on the Gameboy couldn't save data (unless the cartridge itself had an internal battery; this was the case for Zelda and Pokemon Games, among others), so they often relied on passwords that you could write down and then use to resume progress at a certain point. This is the system Choplifter uses.</p>\n\n    <p>After many tries I finally beat Sector 2, level 3, at which point I was provided a password which would allow me to access the next stage, Sector 3, level 1. This was late at night and my cat was sleeping on top of me, so I was morally obligated not to disturb her. I figured I would just look up the code in the morning and all would be right. When I woke up, all was not right.</p>\n\n    <p>If you google \"choplifter 2 passwords\" the first link (as of writing this) brings you to <a href=\"https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/585666-choplifter-ii/cheats\" target=\"blank\">a gamefaqs page</a>, where the password for level 3-1 is listed as 'GDGMPTY'. If you go to your copy of Chopliter II (which I assume you must have) and type this in however, nothing will happen. This is because GDGMPTY is not the correct code.</p>\n\n    <p>Very well, we'll go to the second link that appears when you google Choplifter II passwords. That brings you to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/choplifter-ii/cheats/\" target=\"blank\">a gamespot page</a> where the same password is listed. If you scroll to the footers of these two sites, you'll see that they're actually both managed by Gamespot, so it makes sense that the same information would be provided by both.</p>\n\n    <p>So, you might think you can try the third link on google. It goes to <a href=\"https://www.chaptercheats.com/cheats/gameboy/20216/Choplifter-2-Cheats.htm\" target=\"blank\">a chaptercheats page</a>, which is not managed by gamespot, and yet it still gives the same incorrect password for level 3-1. What's going on here?</p>\n\n    <p>If you look at the two pages managed by Gamespot, you'll see the information was posted there by \"LandOfGameCubes\". If you go to <a href=\"https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/community/LandOfGameCubes/contributions/cheats\" target=\"blank\">the profile page of this user</a>, it says the Choplifter II codes were submitted in February of 2002. On the chaptercheats site, it lists the incorrect code as provided by user amyveras in October of 2006, so we can assume she got the incorrect code from LandOfGameCubes.</p>\n\n    <p>Now, the correct code is 'GDGMPLY', which you can get from any of the other sites that show up in the google search or actually beating level 2-3, which I eventually did again. But let this be a cautionary tale. You can never assume that information you find, even from three different sources, is correct. Here, we saw an error from 2002 spreading to three sites over four years. The only date I could find for the correct password coming online was from October of 2004, from <a href=\"https://www.cheathappens.com/10014-Game_Boy-Choplifter_2_cheats\">cheathappens</a>. So right between LandOfGameCubes and amyveras posting the incorrect password, the correct password was uploaded, but alas, it did not reach everyone in time.</p>\n\n    <p>Now, is there a point to me investigating the history and timeline of Choplifter II passwords online? No. But it was kinda fun.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","export default function Games() {\n  return <div>\n    <h2>Are Games Art?</h2>\n\n    <p>There's actually an answer to this question. As with many things, the answer is \"it depends\".</p>\n\n    <p>If you're like Tolstoy you might say that art is only that which inspires a communication of emotions. If that's the definition you're going by then videogames are absolutely not art. Tetris doesn't exactly inspire the feelies.</p>\n\n    <p>But that definition excludes a wide class of things we typically <em>would</em> consider art. There are tons of movies and songs and books that don't bring out emotions, and yet people consider cinema, music, and literature as forms of art.</p>\n\n    <p>So I would like to posit, for the benefit of mankind, my own definition of art. I would say that a piece of art is</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      that for which engagement is primarily with the author's creative output.\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>This definition handles a lot of edge cases well. Under typical circumstances an operating system, for example, wouldn't be considered a piece of art, because people primarily engage with the specifications of what the operating system was intended to do, which is, for the most part, not an act of creativity. (The earliest operating systems, however, might be considered works of art, as they would have been products of creativity.) But for programmers looking at the source code for an operating system, they might see it as being a work of art, as they're engaging with the creative decisions of the programmers who created the OS.</p>\n\n    <p>This exemplifies why this definition captures what most people mean by \"art\". It's often the case that something is considered art by some but not by others, but most of the time this is a result of people engaging with the work in different ways, rather than something intrinsic to the piece itself.</p>\n\n    <p>For games, most of what the end user engages with is the creative output of the game developers. Even ignoring the parts of the game that are more obviously artistic, like the visuals and music, the gameplay mechanics and even controls can be works of creativity.</p>\n\n    <p>So yeah, I'd say games are art given what I consider most people to mean when they use that word. But it's important to keep in mind that whether or not games are art is entirely dependent on the definition being used, which is ultimately arbitrary. So any philosophical treatises on the subject, as with any subject, are complete wastes of time; \"it depends\" is a perfectly fine answer to stop at.</p>\n  </div>\n}\n","// import Pokemon from './posts/Pokemon'\nimport Moby from       './posts/Moby'\nimport Serfdom from    './posts/Serfdom'\nimport Cello from      './posts/Cello'\nimport Heather from    './posts/Heather'\nimport Algorithms from './posts/Algorithms'\nimport Choplifter from './posts/Choplifter'\nimport Games from      './posts/Games'\n\nexport default function Blog(props) {\n  const posts = [\n    'thoughts on moby dick',\n    'serfdom',\n    \"ranking bach's cello suites\",\n    'heather',\n    \"'what algorithms want' is a bad book\",\n    \"don't trust everything you read\",\n    \"are games art?\",\n  ];\n\n  const dates = [\n    '2019 02 08',\n    '2019 03 17',\n    '2019 06 09',\n    '2019 08 11',\n    '2020 09 06',\n    '2021 02 13',\n    \"2021 06 ??\",\n  ];\n\n  const makeTitle = number => <li>\n    {dates[number]}\n    <span\n      onClick={e => props.handleClick('blog', posts[number])}\n      className='link'>\n        {posts[number]}\n    </span>\n  </li>\n\n  const postList = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < posts.length; i++)\n    postList.push(makeTitle(i));\n\n  const blogHome = <div>\n    <h2>Blog</h2>\n\n    <ul>{postList.reverse()}</ul>\n  </div>;\n\n  return (\n    props.currentPost === posts[0] ? <Moby />:\n    props.currentPost === posts[1] ? <Serfdom /> :\n    props.currentPost === posts[2] ? <Cello /> :\n    props.currentPost === posts[3] ? <Heather /> :\n    props.currentPost === posts[4] ? <Algorithms /> :\n    props.currentPost === posts[5] ? <Choplifter /> :\n    props.currentPost === posts[6] ? <Games /> :\n    blogHome\n    )\n}\n","import Home from './Home'\nimport About from './About'\nimport Blog from './Blog'\n\nexport default function Content(props) {\n  const currentPage = props.state.currentPage;\n  return <div>{\n    currentPage === 'home'  ? <Home  />:\n    currentPage === 'about' ? <About />:\n    currentPage === 'blog'  ? <Blog handleClick={props.handleClick} currentPost={props.state.currentPost}/>:\n    currentPage\n  }</div>\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Header from './Header'\nimport Content from './Content'\n\nexport default class Page extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n\n    this.state = {\n      currentPage: 'home',\n      currentPost: null,\n    }\n\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleClick(requestedPage, currentPost) {\n    this.setState({\n      currentPage: requestedPage,\n      currentPost: currentPost,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <main>\n        <Header handleClick={this.handleClick}/>\n        <Content handleClick={this.handleClick} state={this.state}/>\n      </main>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\n\nimport Page from './components/Page.js';\n\nReactDOM.render(<Page />, document.getElementById('root'));\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
