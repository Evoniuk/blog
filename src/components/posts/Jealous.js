    <h2>English Has Literally Gotten Worse</h2>

    <p>Many people objected when the word "literally" got an additional meaning in some dictionary. I wasn't one of those people. The dictionary captured how people use that word just fine. More importantly though, the way people use that word has always been clear from context, and the original meaning can still be used without confusion.</p>

    <p>There has been a change to English that I do find unfortunate, however. Not because of how it came about or anything; languages change naturally and most of the time that's a good, or at least interesting, thing. This is just an unfortunate case where I think the natural course of change happened to result in a loss for the English language.</p>

    <p>The change I'm referring to is to the meaning of the word "jealous".</p>

    <p>Nowadays, people use the word "jealous" as a synonym for "envious". When person A says they're jealous of person B, chances are they mean they envy person B. But "jealous" did not always mean "envious", but rather the exact opposite. Envy means you want what someone else has. Jealousy meant you don't want others to have what you already have. To be fair, it still <i>can</i> mean this, but using this definition in colloquial English always stands out and feels odd.</p>

    <p>This is where the phrases like "jealous husband" come from. The jealous husband doesn't envy his wife or others, he wants to keep his wife away from others. He doesn't want others to enjoy what he has.</p>

    <p>Unlike most changes in English, the meaning of "jealous" changing to "envious" in common speech is a loss in expressive capabilities. The fact that there was already a word that meant envy ("envy") isn't an issue, every language has plenty of synonyms; the problem is that there isn't a succinct way to capture the idea of jealousy, in the original sense of the word. If you want to say you're jealous of someone or something, in the original sense, you have to use a whole sentence to express what a single word could have expressed. And that's unfortunate.</p>
