    <h2>Are Games Art?</h2>

    <p>There's actually an answer to this question. As with many things, the answer is "it depends".</p>

    <p>If you're like Tolstoy you might say that art is only that which inspires a communication of emotions. If that's the definition you're going by then videogames are absolutely not art. Tetris doesn't exactly inspire the feelies.</p>

    <p>But that definition excludes a wide class of things we typically <em>would</em> consider art. There are tons of movies and songs and books that don't bring out emotions, and yet people consider cinema, music, and literature as forms of art.</p>

    <p>So I would like to posit, for the benefit of mankind, my own definition of art. I would say that a piece of art is</p>

    <blockquote>
      that for which engagement is primarily with the author's creative output.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This definition handles a lot of edge cases well. Under typical circumstances an operating system, for example, wouldn't be considered a piece of art, because people primarily engage with the specifications of what the operating system was intended to do, which is, for the most part, not an act of creativity. (The earliest operating systems, however, might be considered works of art, as they would have been products of creativity.) But for programmers looking at the source code for an operating system, they might see it as being a work of art, as they're engaging with the creative decisions of the programmers who created the OS.</p>

    <p>This exemplifies why this definition captures what most people mean by "art". It's often the case that something is considered art by some but not by others, but most of the time this is a result of people engaging with the work in different ways, rather than something intrinsic to the piece itself.</p>

    <p>For games, most of what the end user engages with is the creative output of the game developers. Even ignoring the parts of the game that are more obviously artistic, like the visuals and music, the gameplay mechanics and even controls can be works of creativity.</p>

    <p>So yeah, I'd say games are art given what I consider most people to mean when they use that word. But it's important to keep in mind that whether or not games are art is entirely dependent on the definition being used, which is ultimately arbitrary. So any philosophical treatises on the subject, as with any subject, are complete wastes of time; "it depends" is a perfectly fine answer to stop at.</p>
